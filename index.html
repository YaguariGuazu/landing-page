                  Before breakfast, spit a generous amount of saliva in a glass of
                  water. I know, but just do it. If your saliva hangs like threads
                  from the surface towards the bottom, you likely have Candida.
                  It's not dangerous, but will have you craving sugar and drain

                <p>
                  A well-balanced food intake is key to general well-being. If
                  your diet consists of superior sources of meat, legumes, fruit
                  and vegetables, you're alright! But if the nutritional base
                  consists of processed foods, with high sugar and fat content,
                  you need to get rid of it. Basically,

                  Reset negative thinking patterns. Although witnessing and experiencing
                  unfortunate events and tragedies can make it difficult to see
                  solutions and be positive,
                  <i>use your willpower. Zoom out to get a clearer picture of your
                    situation and focus on what is within your capabilities to

                  This is an extremely important mineral. Deficiency is very
                  common and can cause fatigue, muscle cramps, mental issues,
                  irregular heartbeat, and osteoporosis.
                  <i>Take a magnesium supplement daily. Better yet, have oatmeal

                  B12 deficiency can cause fatigue, headaches, depression, pale or
                  yellow skin, and mental impairment. These symptoms are not
                  specific to B12 deficiency, and can thus go undetected.

                <h3>VitaminD</h3>
                <p>
                  Vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of minerals. The major
                  natural source of vitamin D is sun exposure. Fatigue, achy
                  bones, muscle weakness, and mood changes like depression are
                  common symptoms of low vitamin D levels.
                  <i>Take a vitamin D supplement with your food once a day during
                    fall and winter!

                <p>
                  <i>Skip it!</i> Milk greases the small intestine and complicates
                  the body's uptake of vitamins and minerals. Consequences might
                  be fatigue, dizziness, and a "foggy" brain. A bloated
                  stomach is also an indication that you're likely lactose
                  intolerant anyway, which makes sense. Cow milk is a super food
                  for calves to grow big quickly. It was never intended for human
                  consumption.

                  <i>Cut down on sweets and sugar significantly! Higher sugar
                    intake leads to tiredness and increases rates of depression
                  </i>
                  and mood disorders. Over time, high sugar levels can
                  also cause type 2 diabetes. Our system efficiently
                  transforms the carbs in our diet to the sugar we need. Added
                  sugar intake through sodas and candy should therefore be avoided
                  altogether if possible.

                  Drink plain water, not tap, unless you have a sophisticated
                  filering system. Tap water can contain pollutants, even
                  dangerous toxins. Avoid caffeinated drinks. They make it hard to
                  retain fluids.
